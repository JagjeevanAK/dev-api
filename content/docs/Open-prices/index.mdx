    authenticity and traceability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Location Verification">
    All locations are verified through OpenStreetMap integration to ensure
    accuracy and prevent fraud
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price Validation">
    Each entry includes timestamp, location data, and proof photos for
    comprehensive price tracking
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Data">
    All price data is made available under open licenses for research,
    applications, and transparency
