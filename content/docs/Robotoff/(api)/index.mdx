## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "meta": {
    "count": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "pages": 10
  }

- `500` - Internal Server Error

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **General endpoints**: 100 requests per minute
- **Image processing**: 20 requests per minute
- **Batch operations**: 5 requests per minute

<Callout type="warning">
  Rate limits may vary based on endpoint complexity and system load. Always
  implement proper error handling and retry logic in your applications.
