The **Robotoff API** provides programmatic access to Open Food Facts' AI-powered product data extraction and processing capabilities. This comprehensive API enables developers to integrate advanced computer vision, machine learning, and data processing features into their applications.

<Callout type="info">
  The Robotoff API is a RESTful service that processes product images, extracts
  structured data, and provides intelligent predictions to enhance product
  information quality.
</Callout>

## Authentication

Most endpoints are publicly accessible. For operations that require authentication, you'll need to provide appropriate credentials through the Open Food Facts authentication system.

## API Categories

The Robotoff API is organized into several functional categories:

### Core Prediction Services

- **Prediction Management**: Manage AI predictions, retrieve prediction results, and handle prediction workflows
- **Image Predictions**: Process product images and extract structured data using computer vision
- **Predict Services**: Direct prediction endpoints for text analysis, language detection, and category prediction

### Content Management

- **Logo Management**: Detect, annotate, and manage product logos and brand marks
- **Annotation Management**: Handle human annotations and crowdsourced data validation
- **Question Management**: Manage validation questions and community feedback workflows

### Image Processing

- **Image Management**: Upload, process, and manage product images for analysis
- **Image Processing**: Advanced image processing operations and OCR capabilities

### Data & Insights

- **Insight Management**: Manage AI-generated insights and data extraction results
- **Dataset Management**: Manage training datasets and model data

### Operations & Monitoring

- **Batch Processing**: Execute and monitor large-scale batch processing operations
- **User Management**: User statistics and contribution tracking
- **ANN Search**: Approximate nearest neighbor search for similar products
- **System Status**: Health checks, API status, and system monitoring

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "meta": {
    "count": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "pages": 10
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error messages:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (authentication required)
- `404` - Not Found (endpoint or resource not found)
- `429` - Rate Limited (too many requests)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **General endpoints**: 100 requests per minute
- **Image processing**: 20 requests per minute
- **Batch operations**: 5 requests per minute

<Callout type="warning">
  Rate limits may vary based on endpoint complexity and system load. Always
  implement proper error handling and retry logic in your applications.
</Callout>

## SDKs and Libraries

While there are no official SDKs, the API follows REST conventions and can be easily integrated using standard HTTP libraries in any programming language:

- **Python**: `requests`, `httpx`
- **JavaScript**: `fetch`, `axios`
- **Java**: `OkHttp`, `HttpClient`
- **PHP**: `Guzzle`, `cURL`
