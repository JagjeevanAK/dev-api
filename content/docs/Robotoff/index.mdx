**Robotoff** is a service that generates predictions from product data such as images, text, and metadata. These predictions can individually or collectively be refined into actionable suggestions known as insights.

<Callout type="info">
  Robotoff automatically extracts data from product images, including
  ingredients, nutritional information, labels, and categories, helping to
  improve the quality and completeness of the Open Food Facts database.
</Callout>

## What does Robotoff do?

Robotoff performs various AI-powered tasks to enhance product data quality:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Image Analysis">
    Extracts text from product images using advanced OCR (Optical Character
    Recognition) technology
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingredient Detection">
    Identifies, parses, and structures ingredient lists from product packaging
  </Step>
  <Step title="Label Recognition">
    Detects quality labels, certifications, and claims (organic, fair trade,
    etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Category Prediction">
    Suggests appropriate product categories based on image content and text
    analysis
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nutrition Extraction">
    Extracts nutritional information tables from product images
  </Step>
  <Step title="Logo Detection">
    Identifies brand logos, quality marks, and certification labels
  </Step>
</Steps>
