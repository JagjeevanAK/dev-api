# Redis Usage

Redis is a versatile database that acts as a synchronization layer between different services in our infrastructure.

<Callout type="info">
  We use Redis in various places across the Open Food Facts infrastructure for
  caching, event streaming, and inter-service communication.
</Callout>

## Redis Deployments

  </Card>
  <Card title="Matomo Integration" href="#matomo">
    Redis queues for handling analytics traffic
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cross-Datacenter" href="#cross-datacenter-access">
    Proxied access between OVH and Free datacenters
  </Card>

## Production Instance for OFF

We have a production instance of Redis dedicated to Open Food Facts operations.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently used for the event stream function to enable other services like
  off-queries, Robotoff, and search-a-licious to update their data.
</Callout>

### Cross-Datacenter Access

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Stunnel Proxy** Redis is proxied between OVH and Free datacenter through
    [stunnel](/docs/Infra/networking/stunnel).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Connection from OVH** 
    To use from ovh1/ovh2, connect to stunnel client server on standard Redis port: 
    ```bash title="Redis Connection" 
    # Connect to Redis through stunnel 
    redis-cli -h 10.1.0.113 -p 6379 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installation Details

<Tabs items={["deployment", "configuration"]}>
  <Tab value="deployment">
    ### Container Deployment
    
    - **Location**: Container 122 on the OFF Proxmox cluster
    - **Data Storage**: `/var/lib/redis` is in a specific dataset
    - **OS**: Simple Debian deployment
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="configuration">
    ### Configuration Management
    <Callout type="info">
      Specific configurations are stored in `confs/off-redis` directory.
    </Callout>
    **System Service**: 
    - Override systemd service to send emails on failure 
    - Automated monitoring and alerting
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Matomo Integration

<Callout type="info">
  [Matomo also uses Redis Queues](/docs/Infra/services/matomo) to handle high
  traffic volumes efficiently.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Queue Processing** Redis manages analytics data queues for Matomo.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Traffic Management** Handles high-volume analytics data processing.
  </Step>
</Steps>
