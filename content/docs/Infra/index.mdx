# Infrastructure Overview

Open Food Facts operates a robust, distributed infrastructure across multiple hosting providers to ensure reliability, performance, and global accessibility of our services.

<Callout title="Community-Supported Infrastructure">
  Our infrastructure is made possible through generous sponsorships from hosting
  providers and the Open Food Facts community, enabling us to provide free
  access to food transparency data worldwide.
</Callout>

## Network Architecture

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load Balancing">
    Traffic is distributed across multiple servers using nginx reverse proxies
    for optimal performance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Content Delivery">
    Static assets and images are served through geographically distributed
    servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Service Isolation">
    Different services run in isolated environments using Docker containers and
    VMs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backup & Recovery">
    Automated backup systems ensure data integrity and disaster recovery
    capabilities
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Web Traffic Proxies

<Callout type="info">
  Most services are hosted on OVH infrastructure and pass through an nginx
  reverse proxy hosted on VM 101 on ovh1, which provides centralized routing and
  SSL termination.
</Callout>

## Service Distribution

### Core Services

- **Product Opener**: Main application and database on free.org servers
- **Robotoff**: AI services running on OVH infrastructure
- **Knowledge Panels**: FastAPI services on containerized infrastructure
- **Search-a-licious**: Elasticsearch-based search on dedicated servers
- **Open Prices**: Django application with Vue.js frontend

### Supporting Infrastructure

- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems
- **Backups**: Automated backup systems across multiple locations
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for global image serving
- **SSL/TLS**: Automated certificate management and renewal

#### Access Control

<Callout type="info" title="IP Tables Rules">
  We limit access to certain services through IP tables rules: - **off2**:
  MongoDB access filtered by IP to enable access from OVH - **ovh1**: IP tables
  rules proxy PGM service requests from off1 and off2
</Callout>
