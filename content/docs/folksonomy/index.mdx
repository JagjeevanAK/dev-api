A lightweight REST API designed for the Open Food Facts Folksonomy Engine.

The Folksonomy Engine API allows you to add free property/value pairs to Open Food Facts products. This collaborative tagging system enables users to contribute additional metadata and properties that enhance product information beyond the standard structured data.

<Callout type="info">
  Folksonomy enables the community to add custom tags and properties to
  products, creating a rich ecosystem of user-generated metadata that
  complements the core product database.
</Callout>

## What is Folksonomy?

Folksonomy is a collaborative classification system that allows users to assign freely chosen keywords (tags) to products. Unlike traditional taxonomies that are hierarchical and controlled, folksonomy is:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User-Driven">
    Community members can add any property/value pairs they find relevant
  </Step>
  <Step title="Flexible">
    No predefined categories - tags can represent any aspect of a product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collaborative">
    Multiple users can contribute and validate tags for better data quality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evolving">
    The tag vocabulary grows organically based on community needs
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Integration

The Folksonomy API integrates with:

- Open Food Facts Product Opener
- Open Food Facts mobile apps
- Third-party applications via REST API

<Callout type="info">
  **Note**: Moderators can access the folksonomy engine directly on Open Food
  Facts without any extension. The UI has not yet been deployed on Open Products
  Facts, Open Pet Food Facts, or Open Beauty Facts, but has been proven to work
  via the extension.
