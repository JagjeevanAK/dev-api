# Folksonomy Engine API

The Folksonomy Engine API allows you to add free property/value pairs to Open Food Facts products. This collaborative tagging system enables users to contribute additional metadata and properties that enhance product information beyond the standard structured data.

<Callout type="info">
  Folksonomy enables the community to add custom tags and properties to
  products, creating a rich ecosystem of user-generated metadata that
  complements the core product database.
</Callout>

## What is Folksonomy?

Folksonomy is a collaborative classification system that allows users to assign freely chosen keywords (tags) to products. Unlike traditional taxonomies that are hierarchical and controlled, folksonomy is:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User-Driven">
    Community members can add any property/value pairs they find relevant
  </Step>
  <Step title="Flexible">
    No predefined categories - tags can represent any aspect of a product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collaborative">
    Multiple users can contribute and validate tags for better data quality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evolving">
    The tag vocabulary grows organically based on community needs

## API Overview

The Folksonomy Engine uses the following main concepts:

- **product**: the product barcode/identifier
- **k**: "key", meaning the property or tag name
- **v**: "value", the value for a related key
- **owner**: optional ownership identifier for private tags

## Common Use Cases

### Product Enhancement

- Add cooking instructions
- Specify dietary restrictions
- Note packaging details
- Include preparation methods

### Community Insights

- Personal reviews and ratings
- Usage recommendations
- Allergen warnings
- Regional availability

### Data Quality

- Correction suggestions
- Additional product names
- Translation contributions
- Quality assessments

### Authentication

Most operations require authentication using Open Food Facts credentials. You can authenticate using:

- Username/password to get a bearer token
- Open Food Facts session cookie

### Tagging System

Tags in the Folksonomy Engine follow a key-value structure where:

- Keys represent the type of information (e.g., "organic", "fair-trade", "source")
- Values provide the specific information for that key
- Tags can be public (visible to all) or private (visible only to the owner)

### Versioning

Each tag has a version number that increments with updates, ensuring data consistency and enabling conflict resolution.

## Getting Started

1. **Authenticate**: Get a bearer token using your Open Food Facts credentials
2. **Add Tags**: Create new product tags with custom properties
3. **Query Data**: Search for products and tags using the flexible API endpoints
4. **Manage Tags**: Update, delete, and version your contributions

<Callout type="warning">
  Be mindful of tag quality and relevance. The Folksonomy system is
  collaborative, so consider the impact of your contributions on the broader
  community.
