A REST API designed for content moderation and issue reporting across the Open Food Facts ecosystem.

The Nutripatrol API is used to report and manage issues with products and images on [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), Open Prices, Open Pet Food Facts, and Open Beauty Facts. It provides a structured system for community-driven content moderation through flags and tickets.

<Callout type="info">
  Nutripatrol helps maintain data quality by allowing users to report inappropriate content, problematic products, and other issues that need review across all Open Food Facts projects.
</Callout>

## Core Concepts

### Flags and Tickets System

Nutripatrol uses a two-tier system for managing content issues:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Flags">
    Reports submitted by users or automated systems about specific issues
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tickets">
    Containers that group related flags for the same product or image
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Process">
    Moderators can review tickets and update their status (open/closed)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Flag Types

The system supports different types of content reports:

- **Product Issues**: Problems with product information or inappropriate products
- **Image Issues**: Inappropriate images, faces, or content that needs removal
- **Search Issues**: Problems with search functionality or results

### Supported Projects

Nutripatrol works across the entire Open Food Facts ecosystem:

- Open Food Facts (OFF)
- Open Beauty Facts (OBF)
- Open Pet Food Facts (OPFF)
- Open Product Facts (OPF)
