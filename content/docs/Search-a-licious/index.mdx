Search-a-licious unlocks the full potential of large data collections by transforming them into easily searchable content. Users can quickly and efficiently find exactly what they need.

<Callout type="info">
  Welcome to the documentation of Search-a-licious, a ready-to-use search
  component built on top of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) that
  transforms data collections into powerful, searchable experiences.
</Callout>

## Executive Summary

Search-a-licious transforms large data collections into searchable content,
allowing users to quickly find what they need with powerful queries, facet
exploration, and visualizations. Originally developed for Open Food Facts,
it's perfect for exposing data, supporting decision-making, and enabling
exploration, unlocking the full potential of open data collections. Developers
can rapidly build apps thanks to its easy configuration, reusable components,
and robust architecture.

## What is Search-a-licious?

With powerful text queries, facet exploration, and intuitive visualizations, Search-a-licious empowers your users to dive deep into data effortlessly.

Developers can rapidly build and deploy new applications based on existing data collections in just hours. The platform offers reusable components that adapt to various contexts, all built on best-in-class open-source tools.

We created this project to leverage collections of (uniform enough) data to build tools that can:
