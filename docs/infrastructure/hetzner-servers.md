# Hetzner Servers

We have some servers at Hetzner.

## Console

You can access the console at https://robot.hetzner.com.

## vSwitch

Because some of our servers have only one NIC (Network Interface Card),
we need to use a vSwitch to connect our servers in a private network
(which is handy for a proxmox cluster).
