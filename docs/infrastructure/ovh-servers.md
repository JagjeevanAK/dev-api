# OVH servers

We currently have 3 servers at OVH:

- ovh1
- ovh2
- ovh3
- ks1

ovh1 and ovh2 are "compute" servers,
they serve a lot of tools and staging environments.

ovh3 is a storage and backup server.

ovh1, ovh2 and ovh3 are fully sponsored by OVH, and we are very grateful for that.

ks1 is a small "kimsufi" server, dedicated to serve images.

## OVH console

We have two OVH accounts:
* one where we have our DNS, registered domain names, etc.
* one for the sponsored servers, were no paid transaction must never be made.

Be sure to verify which account you are using.

## Domain names and DNS

Domaine names and DNS are managed in the "Web Cloud", "domain names"
