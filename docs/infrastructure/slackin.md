# auto Slack invitation

**important** sadly as of 2023-03-23 slackin does not seem to work any more due to [slack API change, that wont be replaced](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin/issues/417) ([see also here](https://github.com/emedvedev/slackin-extended/issues/205), [and here](https://github.com/integrations/slack/issues/1063)).

We did replace it by a very simple static page on the [nginx reverse proxy](nginx-reverse-proxy.md)
with a link that is a permanent invitation to linkedin (go to slack, invite, more details, make invitation permanent).
Sadly it will only last for 400 invitations and then we will have to replace itâ€¦

## Updating slack invitation

In Slack administration:
* go to ["invitations" section](https://openfoodfacts.slack.com/admin/invites)
* Click "Invite people" on the top right corner.
* Click on copy invitation link
* Click on "modify link parameters" next to it
* Change expire parameter to "never expire"

On OVH reverse proxy (or the server slack.openfoodfacts.org is pointing to):
* edit `/var/www/slack/index.html`
* change the href for the Join our slack link with your new link
* save the file
* after that go to /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure to [commit your changes](./how-to-have-server-config-in-git.md)

## Slackin (deprecated)

https://slack.openfoodfacts.org enable users to join our slack without the need for an invitation.

It is based upon the [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin) project
